## Hack assembly language to binary assembler
Created during the course of reading the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles"
Works although I was not able to replicate the exact variable and label mapping procedure used in the results. So output works but
direct code-to-code tests fail.

## Steam Workshop - GoG Mod converter
The program makes mods downloaded from Steam Workshop run GoG game by creating descriptor files for them. Current implementation requires a symbolicly linked folder in the GoG mod directory that points to Steam mods. This due to buit-in limitation of the descriptor file.

## Kivy based calculator
Testing Kivy.
